I am a PhD candidate specializing in Political Behavior and Methodology in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University. 

My substantive research employs quantitative methods to answer questions at the intersection of political psychology and political economy, focusing largely on the topics of taxation, redistribution, and inequality. I am particularly concerned with improving our understanding of how psychological motivations and economic conditions jointly shape distributive preferences and economic beliefs. Accordingly, my dissertation studies the mechanisms by which economic inequality may perpetuate or undermine itself through its effects on beliefs about the deservingness of the rich. In addition to my substantive interests, I also conduct methodological research primarily focused on the measurement of preferences and beliefs.

I am currently a Humane Studies Fellow with the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://theihs.org/) and spent the 2019-2020 academic year as Program for Advanced Research in the Social Sciences (PARISS) Fellow at the [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.duke.edu/). As a proponent of transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in the social sciences, I also serve as Catalyst for the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/).

I have taught or assisted teaching courses in American Politics and Comparative Politics, primarily on topics in political behavior and political economy. My teaching experience reflects my commitment to interdisciplinarity: I have taught courses (cross-)listed in political science, economics, psychology, and writing. Additionally, I have developed and taught workshops on transparent, reproducible, and open research for graduate students and spent a year as a methodological consultant to Duke's student, faculty, and staff researchers as a PARISS Fellow.

In addition to my academic work, I occasionally consult and conduct research for governments, businesses, and NGOs, primarily in the areas of economic development and governance. Both independently and as an affiliated researcher of the [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/), I have contributed to the work of organizations including the [U.K. Department for Innovation, Business & Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills), [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/), [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/), and [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/). I also contribute to the interdisciplinary work of the [Worldview Lab](https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/attitudes/students/worldview-lab/) at Duke University.
